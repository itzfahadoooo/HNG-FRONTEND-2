        Event Ticket Booking UI – Open Source Practice Project 🎟️ Overview This
        is a beginner-friendly yet practical Event Ticket Booking UI designed
        for developers to clone, explore, and build upon. The design focuses on
        a seamless, login-free ticket reservation flow, allowing users to book
        event tickets quickly and efficiently. The project consists of a
        three-step ticket booking flow, and developers can extend it further by
        integrating payment solutions, user authentication (optional), and
        ticket validation systems. Flow & Features 1️⃣ Ticket Selection • Users
        can browse available tickets (Free & Paid). • Ticket options are
        displayed in a list or card view. • For Free Tickets → Clicking “Get
        Free Ticket” proceeds to attendee details. • For Paid Tickets → Clicking
        “Purchase Ticket” would ideally open a payment modal. 2️⃣ Attendee
        Details Form • Users input their Name, Email, and optional Phone Number.
        • Profile picture upload option with preview functionality. • Ticket
        summary is visible to ensure users review their details before
        submission. 3️⃣ Payment or Success Page • If the ticket is free, the user
        is taken directly to the Ticket Confirmation Page. • If the ticket is
        paid, developers can integrate Stripe, Paystack, or Flutterwave to
        process payments before showing the confirmation page. • Upon successful
        booking, users should receive: • A visual ticket preview with a unique
        QR Code. • An option to download the ticket as PDF or save it to their
        device. • An email confirmation containing ticket details. How to Build
        This 🚀 This UI can be implemented using: 📌 Frontend (Next.js or React)
        • Component Breakdown: • TicketCard.tsx → Displays ticket details •
        AttendeeForm.tsx → Captures user details • PaymentModal.tsx → Handles
        payment processing • SuccessScreen.tsx → Shows the final ticket preview
        • State Management: React’s Context API, Zustand, or Redux (if needed).
        • File Handling: Users should be able to upload images (profile picture
        for ticket) using Firebase Storage, Cloudinary, or local preview with
        URL.createObjectURL(). 📌 Backend (Optional) • If persistence is
        required, a backend can be built using: • Node.js & Express or Firebase
        Functions • Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Firebase Firestore to
        store ticket records 📌 Payment Integration • For paid events,
        developers should integrate: • Stripe Checkout (for international
        transactions) • Paystack or Flutterwave (for African users) What You’ll
        Learn 🧑‍💻 • File handling & validation (profile picture uploads). •
        Dynamic UI updates based on ticket selection. • Persisting bookings
        using local state or a backend. • Integrating payment gateways for
        ticket purchases. • Generating & validating QR Codes for event check-in
        (Advanced). Need Help? Reach Out! 💬
